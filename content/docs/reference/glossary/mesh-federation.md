title: Mesh Federation
---
A loosely-coupled set of autonomous [service meshes](#service-mesh) collectively providing the services
for an application. Two service meshes in a federation are isolated from each other and have different service
definitions and independent administrative control. A mesh contributing to the federation may itself be a single
or [multicluster mesh](multicluster-mesh).
